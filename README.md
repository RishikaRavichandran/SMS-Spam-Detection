# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, vectorized, and used to train models such as Na誰ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Neural Network.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and tokenizing SMS messages.
- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW) techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Na誰ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It undergoes preprocessing, including:
- Removing special characters and numbers
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- Stopword removal
